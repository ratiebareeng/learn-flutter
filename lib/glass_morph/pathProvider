The path_provider package provides a platform-agnostic way to access commonly used locations on the deviceâ€™s
file system. The plugin currently supports access to two file system locations:

Temporary directory (cache): that the system can clear at any time. On iOS, this corresponds to the
NSCachesDirectory. On Android, this is the value that getCacheDir() returns.
Documents directory: for the app to store files that only it can access. The system clears the directory
only when the app is deleted. On iOS, this corresponds to the NSDocumentDirectory. On Android, this is
the AppData directory.
